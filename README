To run this code, change matlab's working directory to this directory,
and then run epidemicModel with a single argument. This argument is the
number of timesteps the model will run, and at the moment, should not
exceed 506. A scatterplot will be displayed showing the locations of the
different nodes and infection status. Blue nodes are susceptible, red nodes
are infected and green nodes are cured. The status array will be displayed
on completion. The first column is the ending status of the node, in an ascii
code, the second column is the time that the node will stop being infected,
the third column is the time that the node became infected and the fourth
column is the time that the node became cured.
